/* Shared knobs for the catch (osu!fruits) tracker. v1 was scoped to a
   single country (TW); expanded 2026-09 to global rankings — osu! API v2's
   performance-rankings endpoint caps out around page 200 (~10,000 players)
   regardless, so "global" means that same ceiling, not literally every
   registered player. See docs in _scores-poll-core.js /
   _rankings-crawl-core.js for how the design degrades gracefully (slower
   full-sweep cadence, not breakage) if the real pool turns out bigger than
   a single poll cycle can cover. */
